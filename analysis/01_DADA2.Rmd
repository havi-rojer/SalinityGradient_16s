# Goals of this file

1. Use raw fastq files and generate quality plots to assess quality of reads.
2. Filter and trim out bad sequences and bases from our sequencing files.
3. Write out fastq files with high quality sequences.
4. Evaluate the quality from our filter and trim.

# Load Libraries
```{r load-libraries}
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

#devtools::install_github("benjjneb/dada2")
library(dada2)
```

```{r load-data}
# Set the raw fastq paths to the raw sequencing file
# Path to the fastq files
setwd("/local/workdir/zlr6/git_repos/SalinityGradient_16s")
raw_fastqs_path <- "data/01_DADA2/01_raw_gzipped_fastqs"
raw_fastqs_path

# What files are in this path?
list.files(raw_fastqs_path)

# How many files are there?
str(list.files(raw_fastqs_path))

# Create vector of forward reads
forward_reads <- list.files(raw_fastqs_path, pattern = "R1_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)
# Intuition check
head(forward_reads)
 
# Create vector of reverse reads
reverse_reads <- list.files(raw_fastqs_path, pattern = "R2_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)
# Intuition check
head(reverse_reads)
```

# Quality Plots
```{r raw-quality-plot}
# Randomly select 2 samples from dataset to evaluate
random_samples <- sample(1:length(reverse_reads), size = 2)
random_samples

# Calculate and plot quality of these two samples
plotQualityProfile(forward_reads[random_samples])
plotQualityProfile(reverse_reads[random_samples])
```
